6.37699E+17	barca	0	We now just need less than 4.5 goals in the Barca match and Real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. I may cover our bet before the last match
6.37705E+17	barca	1	Let's go Barca 1 goal before the 1st half ends.
6.37707E+17	barca	0	I hope that Barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.

6.37712E+17	barca	1	I honestly think what we're seeing with Fabregas is really him and why Barca were quick to part ways. Last August-November was a one-off
